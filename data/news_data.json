            "content": "Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Director General Moshe Edri, this morning, addressed the 68th International Atomic Energy (IAEA) General Conference in Vienna, and commented on the regional challenges facing the State of Israel, especially Iran and Syria, which are not honoring their international commitments in this field. He also noted the cooperation between Israel and the IAEA in security and nuclear safety among other fields.Following are excerpts from Director Edri's remarks:Iran continues to be the main source of regional instability, and poses a threat to peace and security worldwide. This reality requires the full attention of the international community, now more than ever before. There is no doubt that Iran conducted a military nuclear program aimed to produce several nuclear weapon devices. Iran continues to advance this program by gaining relevant technology and knowledge, along with fissile material in alarming amounts. Iran has been conducting covert nuclear activities in undeclared sites for many years. The Agency has found concrete evidence of these activities, including the use of undeclared nuclear material and equipment.Despite repeated resolutions by the Board of Governors, Iran has continuously failed to provide technically credible explanations regarding these activities, and continues to deceive the Agency and the international community.Moreover, Iran continues to develop, test and deploy long-range ballistic missiles, and supports terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East, including the Houthi terrorist group that is a significant security threat to the freedom of navigation, and to the global trade routes. A nuclear-armed Iran, equipped with delivery systems, is not an option that Israel, or the world, can, or should tolerate.\"He added:\"As the Director General of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, our national task is to guarantee the safety and security of our nuclear facilities that are openly targeted by Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, even more so since October 7th. Israel continues to demonstrate its responsible behavior in this regard, and continues to take all necessary precautions to ensure that these facilities are operated according to the highest international safety and security standards to withstand these threats as required.\"This year's conference is being held from 16-20 September. AEC Director General Edri is chairing Israel's delegation, which is composed of AEC and Foreign Affairs Ministry representatives.",

They should know that we exact a high price for any attempt to attack us.Whoever needs a reminder of this, is invited to visit the port of Hodeidah.Whoever attacks us will not evade our strike. Hamas is already learning this through our determined action, which will bring about its destruction and the release of all of our hostages.I have visited the north.I am attentive to the residents of the north. I speak with them and with the heads of local authorities in the north, I see their distress. I hear their anguish.The current situation will not continue. This requires a change in the balance of forces on our northern border. We will do whatever is necessary to return our residents securely to their homes.I am committed to this. The Government is committed to this and we will not suffice with less than this.We will do this thanks to the heroism of our fighters and the unity among us, as a united people rising up against our enemies in order to ensure our future.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note, if there is any difference or conflict between the information on this page and the law, the provisions of the law will apply.",

            "content": "The Prime Minister's Office, this evening:The fact that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acceded to every American proposal for releasing the hostages despite the ultimatum from elements in the coalition completely refutes the claim that he has torpedoed any deal whatsoever due to political considerations.On April 27th, the Prime Minister conveyed to the mediator a framework for releasing the hostages, which Secretary of State Blinken defined as being a very generous proposal. On May 31st, the Prime Minister agreed to the US proposal, and on August 16th, he agreed to the American \"final bridging proposal.\"On June 12th, Secretary of State Blinken said that Israel had agreed to the proposal while Hamas had not. On August 28th, the Deputy Director of the CIA said that Israel was showing a seriousness in the negotiations that the leader of Hamas would have to respond to. On September 9th, US Special Envoy to the Middle East McGurk said that there was no hostage release deal only because of Hamas's refusal. On September 9th, even Benny Gantz admitted that, \"Hamas has not accepted the framework for months and the world is expected to back Israel.\"The false claims in the media against Prime Minister Netanyahu echo the propaganda of the Hamas terrorist organization and invert reality. Prime Minister Netanyahu has already brought about the release of 154 hostages, 117 of whom are alive, and will continue to utilize all means to release the hostages.Whoever wants to assist in the effort to release our hostages needs to pressure the murderer Sinwar and not the Prime Minister&nbsp;of&nbsp;Israel.",
